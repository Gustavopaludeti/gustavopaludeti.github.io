  <h2>Long Scrolling Website inspiration</h2>
<p>
	For this long scrolling web i want to create a infographic where you learn more about coffee.
  Its an excessively consumed beverage that some people are very ignorant about. So i want to create a simple way
  for people to understand that there's more to the drink they drink every morning. I want to achieve this by giving
  the user 4 simple steps about the basics of coffee. The first will be what types of roasts there are out their.
  Then figuring out what type of method a person may like, whether it be pour over or those weird K Cups.
  Possibly even add something about the coarseness of coffee. Then iâ€™d tell them to enjoy their coffee,
  and by then hopefully they would have learned something.
